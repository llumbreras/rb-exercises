# This is a modified version of a challenge delivered to my batch by Jos√© Carlos Monteiro that taught me 
# and several of my classmates a lot about Ruby just by accepting and working through it:
#
# Write a program that asks for user input, then changes that input from one temperature unit to another based upon the user's wishes.
#
# Write code to handle user input. 
#
# That code must include a succinct explanation of how the user should type the values 
# so the program can understand if it's meant to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice-versa. 
# It will then proceed to "parse" the input and obtain two "values": "conversion to make" and "value to use", 
# where the first means to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice-versa and the second is the temperature value to be converted.
#
# Write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code - method(s) - for the conversion process, 
# assuming that the temperature value is always passed as a Float. This is to "prevent" you from writing code to validate the argument. 
# But that doesn't mean you shouldn't validate the value. Meaning that you shouldn't worry if the argument is or is not a Float - 
# assume it is - and instead worry if the value is within an "acceptable range". Consider absolute zero.
#
# If you want to take this challenge even further, then make the conversion program also able to handle other units of temperature 
# (such as Kelvin, Rankine, etc).
#
# Note: the intention here is not to have you code lines and lines of statements but to think in out-of-the-box, abstract ways:
#
# Tip 1: Kelvin is just an "adjustment" of another calculation. ;-)
# Tip 2: A conversion of a value can be seen as unit_from, unit_to, value_to_convert. 
#        An abstract example would be to convert 100 from Euros to US Dollars.
# 
# Some Wikipedia References:
#
# Celsius
# Fahrenheit
# Kelvin
# Comparison of temperature scales
#
#  A note from Jose:
#
#  There are several goals with this challenge:
#
#
#  Having yet more fun with Ruby around week 2.
#  Starting to walk the path of DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.
#  Keeping close attention not to break any progress made, unless state otherwise.
#  Learning to "uphold" the contract between the person asking for features and the delivery of those features.
#  You people can also challenge one another, this is not one-direction. 
#  You can also look for gems that handle temperature conversions or other conversions such as distance. 
#  How about a currency exchange rate conversion? Or building up upon code posted by others, 
#  for example improving someone's code with input validation or stretching another's code to handle more units, 
#  or fixing another's code bugs...
